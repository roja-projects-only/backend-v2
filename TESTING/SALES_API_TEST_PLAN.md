## Access Control Validation

### Staff User (role: STAFF)
- ✅ Can create sales (assigned to their userId)
- ✅ Can view only their own sales
- ✅ Can update only their own sales
- ✅ Can delete only their own sales (within 24 hours)
- ✅ All analytics filtered to their data only
- ❌ Cannot filter by userId in list endpoint
- ❌ Cannot view/modify other users' sales

### Admin User (role: ADMIN)
- ✅ Can view all sales across all users
- ✅ Can update any sale
- ✅ Can delete any sale (no time restriction)
- ✅ Can filter by specific userId
- ✅ All analytics show global data
- ✅ Full access to all endpoints

## Automatic Calculations

### Total Calculation
- ✅ On create: `total = quantity × unitPrice`
- ✅ On update with quantity change: recalculates total
- ✅ On update with unitPrice change: recalculates total
- ✅ On update with both: recalculates total
- ✅ Stored as decimal in database (precise calculations)

## Audit Logging

### Tracked Actions
- ✅ CREATE: Captures all sale fields
- ✅ UPDATE: Captures before/after for changed fields only
- ✅ DELETE: Captures deleted sale data
- ✅ Includes userId, userAgent, ipAddress where available

## Data Validation

### Zod Schema Validation
- ✅ createSaleSchema: customerId (CUID), quantity (≥0.1), unitPrice (≥0.01), date (YYYY-MM-DD), notes (optional)
- ✅ updateSaleSchema: all fields optional, same validations
- ✅ saleFiltersSchema: pagination, dates, optional filters
- ✅ saleIdSchema: CUID format
- ✅ dateParamSchema: YYYY-MM-DD format
- ✅ dateRangeSchema: startDate + endDate required
- ❌ Invalid formats rejected with 400 error

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- ✅ Proper indexing on foreign keys (customerId, userId)
- ✅ Date index for efficient filtering
- ✅ Pagination support to limit results
- ✅ Efficient aggregation queries (GROUP BY)
- ✅ Include/select optimization for joins

### Aggregation Queries
- ✅ Daily trend: Groups by date with _sum and _count
- ✅ Location performance: Manual grouping via Map (covers all 10 locations)
- ✅ Summary: Single aggregate query + distinct customers + top customer

## Edge Cases

- ✅ Empty result sets handled gracefully
- ✅ Missing optional fields (notes, topCustomer)
- ✅ Date timezone handling (Asia/Manila assumed in frontend)
- ✅ 24-hour deletion window for staff (based on createdAt)
- ✅ Customer existence and active status validation
- ✅ Access control at both service and repository layers
